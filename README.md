# ‚ú® Predicting Star Sizes with Artificial Intelligence üå†

This [web-application](https://starsize.streamlit.app/) allows you to do the following:
1. Generate a synthetic dataset of stars with `n` number of stars provided by the user as input.
2. This dataset includes the synthetic brightness of the stars and respective synthetic true sizes.
3. It then uses artificial intelligence (specifically, linear regression) to predict the star sizes based on the brightness values of the stars.
4. It will then allow you to plot the predictions and see how the model performed on this unseen dataset.

## ü§î Why Synthetic Dataset is Being Used?
* The project aims to help Spartificial students understand linear regression using gradient descent.
* Students create a dataset by applying noise to a true output equation, facilitating prediction equation generation.
* This process demonstrates how gradient descent optimizes weights (coefficients) and bias (intercept).
* The optimized values of weight and bias are then utilized in a web application.
* Future projects will involve real astronomical datasets to enhance their machine learning skills.

6. Run the frontend powered by Streamlit:
   ```bash
   streamlit run frontend.py
   ```

## üîß Tools used in This Project
1. **FastAPI** - To build the API endpoints
2. **Streamlit** - To build and host the frontend of the web application
3. **Render** - To host the backend API built using FastAPI
4. **NumPy** - To create the synthetic dataset for training, validation, testing, and the web application
5. **Matplotlib** - To visualize the cost vs iterations and in the web application to visualize the regression line
6. **Pandas** - To read CSV files, create the dataframe, and save dataframes back to CSV
